Create the Decision Tree Classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict hte right class accordingly. Decision Trees are versatile Machine Learning algorithms that can perform both classification and regression tasks, and even multioutput tasks. For the given 'Iris' Dataset. I have created the Decision Tree classifier and visualized it graphically
